## Important Resources (Highly Recommended)

All key materials, lecture PDFs, curated problems, and C++ reference codes are available in the centralized resource repository:

ðŸ”— **[Mastering Algorithms Project Resources](https://github.com/AayushKumar26/Mastering_Algorithms_Project_Resources)**

This repository contains:

- Weekly theory and concept PDFs  
- Structured C++ code implementations  
- Handpicked problem links (Codeforces, LeetCode, etc.)  
- Cheat sheets and algorithm summaries  

---

## Project Overview

**Mastering Algorithms** was conducted from **May to July 2024** under the mentorship of:

- Venkatesh (Y22 CSE)  
- Kumar Shivam (Y22 CSE)  
- Nipun Nohria (Y22 CSE)  
- Yash Pratap Singh (Y22 CSE)

The project aimed to strengthen foundational and advanced topics in algorithms through a well-structured 8-week curriculum, regular problem-solving, and one-on-one mentorship.

## Learning Outcomes

- Proficiency in **C++ STL**, **modular arithmetic**, **bit manipulation**, and **data structures**
- Strong grasp of **recursion**, **greedy**, **dynamic programming**, and **graph algorithms**
- Exposure to **combinatorics**, **game theory**, and **probabilistic techniques**
- Enhanced readiness for **competitive programming** and **technical interviews**
