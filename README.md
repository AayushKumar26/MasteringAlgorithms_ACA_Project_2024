# Mastering Algorithms | ACA Summer Project'24

A comprehensive, mentor-guided project organized under **Association of Computer Activities (ACA), Society of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur** to help students master algorithmic problem-solving for competitive programming and technical interviews.

## Project Overview

**Mastering Algorithms** was conducted from **May to July 2024** under the mentorship of:

- Venkatesh (Y22 CSE)
- Kumar Shivam (Y22 CSE)
- Nipun Nohria (Y22 CSE)
- Yash Pratap Singh (Y22 CSE)

This structured initiative focused on strengthening algorithmic foundations through:

- Weekly conceptual deep-dives in C++ and core algorithmic topics
- Application of number theory, graph theory, dynamic programming, and more
- Regular hands-on problem-solving through Codeforces, LeetCode, and custom curated challenges

## Learning Outcomes

- Proficiency in **C++ STL**, **modular arithmetic**, **bit manipulation**, and **advanced data structures**
- Strong foundation in **recursion**, **greedy techniques**, **dynamic programming**, and **graph algorithms**
- Algorithmic thinking using **game theory**, **combinatorics**, and **probability**
- Speed and accuracy for **coding rounds** and **technical interviews**
